anova.mars.R - Analysis of Variance Table

mars.R - an object of class 'mars' that include the final regression and a description of the basis functions. There are plot, predict, anova, summary and print methods for mars objects.

plot.mars.R - the plot function inputs the mars object and shows various diagnostic plots as output. The plot outputs include Residuals vs Leverage, Residuals vs Fitted, Normal Q-Q and Scale-Location.

predict.mars.R - return the predicted values of the model for given new data.

print.mars.R - print out formula, knot, coefficient, model.

summary.mars.R: including the basis function with intercept and components, Call, Residuals, Coefficients, and its test Statistics.

test.mars.R: including the three chosen dataset from library(ISLR), Auto, College, and Hitters. Display and return the corresponding outputs given by all the methods contained in mars function.
